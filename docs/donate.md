I've been working on Scrapling and other public projects in my spare time and have invested considerable resources and effort to provide these projects for free to the community. By becoming a sponsor, you'd be directly funding my coffee reserves, helping me continuously update existing projects and potentially create new ones.

You can sponsor me directly through [Github sponsors program](https://github.com/sponsors/D4Vinci) or [Buy Me A Coffe](https://buymeacoffee.com/d4vinci). If you are a **company** and looking to **advertise** your business through Scrapling or another project, check out the available plans on my [Github Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/D4Vinci).

Below is the list of our Gold tier sponsors.

Thank you, stay curious, and hack the planet! ‚ù§Ô∏è
